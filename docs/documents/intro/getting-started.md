## Getting started

This crash course requires [playground with default renderer](https://github.com/rezoner/playground/blob/master/build/playground.js)  built on top of __&lt;Canvas&gt;__ element.

Or you can read about [integration with Three.js](<?=cms::url('three')?>)

## Start the application

```javascript
var app = playground({

});
```

Or if this suits your code style more:

```javascript
var app = new PLAYGROUND.Application({

});
```
